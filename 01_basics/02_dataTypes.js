// we dont have to mention the 
// data type like that we do in the C language, 
// like int A = 2;
// we have to instead just write
// let A = 2; this automatically understands the 
// int data type

console.log(typeof(null)); // null is an object not a type! null ko data type is object!
console.log(typeof(undefined)); // type of undefined is undefined itself!
// this above 2 typeof things is an interview questions!!!
